**Scope:** proves the basic functionality of the code is working.

**Testers:** Developers.

**Timing:** at the very begining.

## Integration Test:
**Purpose:** validate that entire code works as expected after making new change. Expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Test drivers and test stubs should be used to assist.

**Scope:** proves the change does not break any of the existing functionality.

**Testers:** Developers.

**Timing:** after successful execution of unit tests.

## End to End Test:
**Purpose:** 

**Scope:** 

**Testers:** Quality Assurance Engineers.

**Timing:** after successful execution of both unit as well as integration test.

<!-- This test is not is action on node-disk-manager for now -->
## User Acceptance Test:
**Purpose:** It allows the end users to complete one final review of the system.

**Scope:** 

**Testers:** End Users.
